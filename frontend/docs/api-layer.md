### Use a single instance of the API client

No matter if your application is consuming RESTful or GraphQL API, have a single instance of the API client that's been pre-configured and reused throughout the application. E.g have a single API client ([axios](https://github.com/axios/axios) / [graphql-request](https://github.com/prisma-labs/graphql-request) / [apollo-client](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/)) instance with pre-defined configuration.

[API Client Example Code](../src/lib/axios.js)

### Define and export request declarations

Instead of declaring API requests on the go, have them defined and exported separately. If it's a restful API a declaration would be a fetcher function that calls an endpoint. On the other hand, requests for GraphQL APIs are declared via queries and mutations that could be consumed by data fetching libraries such as [react-query](https://react-query.tanstack.com/), [apollo-client](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/), [urql](https://formidable.com/open-source/urql/), etc. This makes it easier to track which endpoints are defined and available in the application You can also type the responses and infer it further for a good type safety of the data. You can also define and export corresponding api hooks from there.

### Axios Authenticated Requests

Example of full Axios lifecycle:

https://axios-http.com/docs/example

```
axios.get(`/api/getUser/${id}`)
  .then((response) => {
    // handle success
    console.log(response);
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    // handle error
    console.log(error);
  })
  .then(() => {
    // always executed
  });
return () => {
  // cleanup
};
```

AXIOS POST REQUEST

```
const token = '..your token..'

axios.post(url, {
  //...data
}, {
  headers: {
    'Authorization': `Basic ${token}`
  }
})
```

AXIOS GET REQUEST

```
axios.get('https://api.github.com/user', {
  headers: {
    'Authorization': `token ${access_token}`
  }
})
.then((res) => {
  console.log(res.data)
})
.catch((error) => {
  console.error(error)
})
```
